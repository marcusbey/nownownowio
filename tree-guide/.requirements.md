# NowNowNow Product Requirements Document

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

### 1.1 User Registration

#### 1.1.1 Magic Link Flow

A. New Email Registration

- User enters new email on signup form
  - System validates email format
  - If email is new:
    - Send magic link email
    - Show "Check your email" message
    - Email contains validation button/link
    - User clicks validation link
    - System creates new account
    - Auto sign in user
    - Redirect to "/for-you" feed page

B. Existing Email Handling

- User enters existing email on signup form
  - System checks email existence
  - If email exists:
    - Show sign-in modal automatically
    - Pre-fill email in sign-in form
    - Offer options:
      1. Request new magic link for sign-in
      2. Use password if set
      3. Use available OAuth providers
    - If user requests magic link:
      - Send sign-in magic link
      - Show "Check your email" message
    - If user chooses OAuth:
      - Initiate provider flow
      - Link accounts if needed

C. Magic Link Validation States

- Valid magic link clicked

  - For new email → Create account & sign in
  - For existing email → Sign in to existing account
  - Update last login timestamp
  - Set authentication session
  - Redirect to "/for-you" page

- Invalid magic link scenarios
  - Expired link → Show expiration message with new link request option
  - Already used link → Show "Link already used" with sign-in option
  - Tampered link → Show security warning
  - Link for deleted account → Show account recovery option

#### 1.1.2 Provider Registration (OAuth)

- User clicks provider button (Google/Twitter)
  - System initiates OAuth flow
  - Provider authentication window opens
  - User authorizes application
  - Provider returns OAuth tokens
  - System creates new user account
  - Auto sign in user
  - Redirect to "/for-you" feed page
  - If provider email exists → Link accounts
  - If error during OAuth → Show error message

#### 1.1.3 Multi-Device & Multi-Provider Scenarios

- Cross-Device Authentication
  - User logged in on Device A, attempts login on Device B
    - Show active session notification on both devices
    - Option to maintain both sessions or force logout others
    - Real-time session status updates across devices
    - Handle connection loss between devices
- Multiple Provider Authentication
  - User signs up with Google, later uses LinkedIn
    - Check email match across providers

    - If no match → Ask user if they want to link accounts
    - Maintain provider-specific tokens separately
- Account Merging Scenarios
  - User has multiple accounts with different providers
    - Provide account merging interface
    - Migrate all data (posts, follows, etc.) to primary account
    - Handle conflicts (e.g., different display names)
    - Allow user to choose primary account
- Session Management

    - Display list of active devices/locations
    - Allow individual session termination
    - Force logout from all devices option
    - Session timeout policies per device
- Security Considerations

  - System shows both options:
    1. Password input field
    2. "Sign in with Magic Link" button
  - Email field is common for both methods
  - Clear toggle between methods
  - Remember last used method

B. Password Authentication

- User chooses password method
  - Enter email and password
  - Validate credentials
  - If valid:
    - Create session
    - Redirect to "/for-you"
  - If invalid:
    - Show error message
    - Increment failed attempt counter
    - Suggest magic link after 3 failed attempts
    - Lock password attempts after 5 fails (15 min)

C. Magic Link Option

- User chooses magic link

  - Send magic link email
  - Show "Check your email" message
  - Link expires in 10 minutes
  - One-time use only
  - Previous links invalidated when new one sent

D. Concurrent Authentication Methods

- Handling multiple sign-in attempts:

  - User requests magic link, then tries password:
    - Both methods remain valid
    - First successful method wins
    - Other method invalidated after successful login
  - User enters wrong password, switches to magic link:
    - Reset failed password counter
    - Previous magic links remain valid
    - Success with either method acceptable

E. Security Considerations

- Rate limiting across both methods
  - Combined attempt limit (10 per hour)
  - Separate tracking for password/magic link
  - IP-based rate limiting
- Account protection
  - Notify user of authentication method switch
  - Alert on multiple failed attempts
  - Log authentication method used
  - Option to disable either method
  - Require recent authentication for sensitive actions
