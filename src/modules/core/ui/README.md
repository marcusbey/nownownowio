# UI Components

This directory contains all reusable UI components following our component-first architecture.

## Directory Structure
- /posts: Post-related components (PostCard, PostEditor, etc.)
- /comments: Comment system components (CommentList, CommentForm, etc.)
- /auth: Authentication components (LoginForm, SignupForm, etc.)

## Guidelines
- Use absolute imports (@/components/ui/...)
- Follow functional component patterns
- Maintain TypeScript types
- Keep components small and focused
