# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines performance optimizations implemented to improve the application's efficiency, particularly around network requests and caching.

## Network Request Optimization

### Problems Identified

1. **Duplicate Requests**: The network trace showed multiple identical requests for the same resources:

   - `/api/v1/posts/{postId}/views` being called repeatedly for the same posts
   - `/api/v1/posts/{postId}/likes` being called multiple times unnecessarily
   - All requests were GET with 200 responses but no caching

2. **Request Timing**: Requests were clustered around specific time points, suggesting component remounting or batch loading that triggered new request waves.

3. **Small Responses**: Each response was small (271-294 bytes) but the volume of duplicate requests created unnecessary load.

### Implemented Solutions

1. **React Query Configuration Enhancement**:

   - Increased `staleTime` from 1 minute to 5 minutes
   - Increased `gcTime` from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
   - Disabled automatic refetching on mount and window focus
   - Added request deduplication

2. **Component Optimization**:

   - Added reference tracking to prevent duplicate view tracking
   - Used React Query's cache to avoid repeated data fetching
   - Optimized the Like Button to prevent unnecessary refetches

3. **Batch API Endpoints**:

   - Created a new `/api/v1/posts/batch-stats` endpoint to fetch multiple post statistics in a single request
   - Implemented a `usePostBatchStats` hook for efficient fetching of multiple post stats

4. **HTTP Caching**:
   - Added proper cache headers to API responses
   - Used `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300` for appropriate browser and CDN caching

## Implementation Details

### React Query Configuration

The main React Query configuration in `app/providers.tsx` was updated to use more aggressive caching:

```tsx
new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      refetchInterval: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### HTTP Cache Headers

Cache headers were added to API responses to leverage browser and CDN caching:

```typescript
// Add cache headers
const headers = new Headers();
headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300");

return NextResponse.json(data, {
  status: 200,
  headers,
});
```

### Batch Stats API

A new batch endpoint was created to reduce the number of API calls needed to fetch post statistics:

```typescript
// GET /api/v1/posts/batch-stats
// Body: { postIds: string[], stats: string[] }
// Response: { postId: { views: number, likes: number, comments: number } }
```

## Testing and Impact

Before optimization:

- 20+ individual GET requests for view counts
- 5+ individual GET requests for likes
- No HTTP caching

After optimization:

- 1-2 batch requests for multiple post statistics
- Proper HTTP caching for repeat requests
- Significantly reduced network traffic and improved loading performance

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider moving more data fetching to the server side for initial page loads

2. **Edge Caching**: Implement edge caching for frequently accessed data

3. **Real-time Updates**: Consider implementing WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates instead of polling

4. **Bundle Optimization**: Review and optimize JavaScript bundle sizes to reduce initial load time
