            We're reaching out to inform you that your account has reverted to our
            basic access level. This change is due to the recent issues with your
            premium subscription payment.
          </EmailText>
          <EmailText>
            While you'll still enjoy our core services, access to premium features
            is now limited. We'd love to have you back in our premium community!
          </EmailText>
          <EmailText>
            To reactivate your premium status, simply update your payment
            information here:
